Build a modern, visually engaging consultancy website inspired by the UI/UX of enyata.com, tapcareers.io, and awesomity.rw. Use Next.js as the framework. Structure the site so that each major section is on a separate page for clarity and scalability. The design should be clean, professional, and conversion-focused, with a consistent color palette, bold typography, and ample white space. Prioritize mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
